# Fractions

Let's look at multiplying fractions first, as that's the easiest thing to explore.

## Multiplying fractions

Here's an example:

```
 1     2
--- x ---
 2     3
```

The maths method:

1. Multiply the top numbers together (the numerators)
1. ...and the bottom numbers together (the denominators)
1. Simplify the resulting fraction.

Can we generalise this? How about this...

```
 a     c
--- x ---
 b     d
```

Steps 1 and 2 above would produce...

```
 ac
----
 bd
```

## Programming Task 1:

Write a program to acheive these two steps, taking a, b, c and d as inputs.

Optionally you could build a UI (say in HTML and JavaScript) so that the user enters these numbers in a form arranged as two fractions, a above b, next to c above d.

## Simplifying the fraction

We don't stop with a fraction such as this:

```
 33
----
 44
```

...we would simplify it by spotting that the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 11. So we can arrive at the final answer of

```
 3
---
 4
```

## Programming Task 2:

Complete step 3, the simplication of the fraction. Hint: generate a list of factors for the numerator and denominator.
