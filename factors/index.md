# Factors

## Lowest Common Multiple

We can use a visual programming language like MIT Scratch to explore lowest common multiples. In the tasks below we look at periodic events and when they co-incide. 

## Programming Task 1

Make a lighthouse sprite and add some code so that it flashes every 5 seconds. 

Duplicate this lighthouse sprite and code so that you have two lighthouses. 

Make sure they both flash together when you click the flag.

What number of seconds do you need to use on each lighthouse so that:

1. the first flashes twice as many times as the second? 
2. the second flashes three times as many times as the first?

## Programming Task 2

Now add a third light house, what number of seconds for:

3. the first flashes twice as many times as the second and three times as many times as the third?

Finally, do some LCM maths to prove what you see in Scratch is correct.
