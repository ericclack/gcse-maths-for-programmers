# Frequency Tables

We can use frequency tables to see how data is distributed. For
example, if we roll a dice many times, how many 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s,
and 6s do we get?

## Rolling a dice

Here's a simple function that simulates a dice roll:

```
def roll(): return 3
```

Can you see the problem with it? Try running it and see what happens. 

How can you fix it? Hint: the `random` module and `randint` can help us. 

## Collecting the data

So if we roll our dice lots of times we can collect the results and
draw a frequency table. 

We can store the results in a list, with each item of the list
corresponding to the result of the dice roll. 

We can do this in Python like so: 

```
# Make an empty list
frequencies = [0] * 7

# Roll the dice and collect the results
for i in range(100):
    r = roll()
    frequencies[r] += 1
    
print(frequencies)
```

## Draw a frequency table

Now that we have the data, let's draw a simple text table.

We need do loop through our data, and get the dice number and the 
number of times we saw that result.

Here's how to do it: 

```
def print_frequency_tab(f):
    print("| Value | Freq | Graph")
    print("|-------|------|------")
    for i,v in enumerate(f):
        print("| {:>5} | {:>4} | {}".format(i, v, "*" * v))
```

The parts like `{:>5}` control how the numbers are printed. This
means use a width of 5 characters for the value and right align it.

## Calculating averages

Do you remember the different measures of a set of data? 

* Mode -- this is the most common item
* Range -- this is the difference between the highest and lowest value, watch out for rows in your table with zero frequency
* Median -- this is the middle value of all the data
* Mean -- this is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values

How would we determine these from the data table? Which can you either see
or easily calculate? 

## Types of distributions

### One dice

So, as you increase the number of rolls what happens? And as you reduce the
number of rolls? Why is this? 

### Two dice

Let's now use two dice and add them together, what does this do to the
distribution?

You'll need to change the length of your frequencies array -- to what? 

And you'll need to change the line `r = roll()` to `r = roll() + roll()`.

### Three dice

What happens with 3 dice, or 6 or more?
